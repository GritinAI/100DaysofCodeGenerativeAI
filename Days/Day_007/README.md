Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! Today, we’ll cover Generative AI in a Nutshell and the differences between Generative AI vs. Descriptive AI.

### Generative AI

Generative AI involves models that can create new content, such as text, images, and music, based on training data. It’s widely used in fields like content creation, art, and chatbots.
