Welcome to Day 23 of the 100 Days of Code challenge! 

Today, we continue learning about Vector Embeddings, where we’ll focus on a practical example of how to choose embeddings for your AI models.

Learn how to make the right choices when selecting embeddings, which can significantly impact the performance and accuracy of your machine learning models. We’ll walk through a practical example to help solidify your understanding.
