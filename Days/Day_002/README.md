Welcome to Day 2 of our "100 Days of Code" challenge! Today, we’ll learn about the basics of Python.

**Python** is a versatile programming language used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.

Start with a basic "Hello, World!" program to familiarize yourself with Python syntax.

**Variables:** Use variables to store data. For example, name = "Alice" assigns the string "Alice" to the variable name.

**Receiving Input:** Get user input with input(). For instance, user_name = input("Enter your name: ") allows the user to enter their name.

**Type Conversion:** Convert data types using functions like int(), float(), and str(). For example, age = int("25") converts the string "25" to an integer.

**Strings:** Strings are sequences of characters. For example, "Hello, World!" is a string.

**Arithmetic Operations:** Perform basic arithmetic like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

**Operator Precedence:** Python follows order of operations, similar to math, with parentheses having the highest precedence.

**Comparison Operators:** Use operators like ==, !=, >, < to compare values.

**Logical Operators:** Combine conditions using and, or, and not.
